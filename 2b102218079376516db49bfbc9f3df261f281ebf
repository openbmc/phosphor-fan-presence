      "message": "Good question - \nIn fan-presence, I can see the first read not working, but that\u0027s OK because 1) we already OR in the GPIO presence for the real presence value, and 2) it handles PC signals so as soon as the fans start to spin we\u0027d get the new value. \n\nIn fan-monitor, it doesn\u0027t care until either the system is powered on, or if a reboot at runtime, until the \u0027monitor start delay\u0027 has expired which is 30s for us.",
