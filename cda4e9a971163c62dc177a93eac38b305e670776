Do we need to revisit that or document it one way or the other?\n\nHere is what the docs say today:\n\nWe strive to keep our code conforming to and utilizing of the latest in C++ standards. Today, that means all C++ code should be compiled using C++14 compiler settings. As the C++17 standard is finalized and compilers support it, we will move to it as well.",
