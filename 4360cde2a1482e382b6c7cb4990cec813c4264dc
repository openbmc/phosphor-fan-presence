      "message": "Hmm, so this doesnt actually stop the poweron from happening. This was allowed in fan monitor since that would trip the fan watchdog (which may or may not be correct). I think with us adding this ability now, we should directly poweroff a system... which may mean some additional tweaking here to handle BMC reboots at runtime depending on how `powerStateOn` is reflected down that functional path.\n\nLet me think over what we should do here some more and get back to you.",
