      "message": "this branch doesn\u0027t get called. because technically the compat service IS running, its just not populated. The reason the below code exists is because that was the only way I could get proper detection to partially work before I used the OO design. \n\nso good news: I think the entire _compatibleMatch can be eliminated. the bad news: I dont know why and I hope it\u0027s not just due to a race condition. I\u0027m hoping the reason is because the class that contains the match keeps it in scope properly.",
