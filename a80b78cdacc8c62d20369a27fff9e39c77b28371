OR it would catch if the OperationalStatus interface/Functional property is not found on the tach sensor inventory object.\n\nBut in our current service file setup, inventory is required to be started prior to fan monitoring starting and fan monitor is the one to add OperationalStatus/Functional to inventory upon starting so maybe we should default inventory for this tach sensor to true if we ever get here?",
