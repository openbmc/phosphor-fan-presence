Are you sure 37186 was rebased on this change?  If it wasn\u0027t, it would be seeing this issue.\n\nGiven that this is what fixed the subtree update, to revert this would require reverting the subtree as well, which seems more difficult than simply finding the issue, but it\u0027s up to you if you think that\u0027s best.",
