      "message": "I tested this out using the Decorator.Compatible interface in our EM config, and it worked well.\n\nIn fact it worked well enough that that I can\u0027t think of a reason to use the IBMCompatible one at all.\n\nSo while I could do a follow up a commit to just remove the IBMCompatible stuff, it might save work if you just ripped out that support from this commit, which would just be removing the ifdefs.\n\nI would need to get the commits into EM to add the new iface on our chassis files, and also rename our config files directories to match the new com.ibm.Hardware value in the Names property.\n\nHowever, we aren\u0027t building master directly at this time so if this one went in first I don\u0027t think anyone would notice.\n\nWhat do you think?",

      "message": "If it\u0027s clear that this one is going in the right direction, I really don\u0027t mind it being merged now or later. And I think it\u0027s better to take actions in IBM side first like you said, as it can straighten many things out (about the format of the Names value as Patrick seems to intend to change it to better fit reality,...).\n\nI will need to remove the ifdefs in the code body, the build options and the \"xyz.openbmc_project.Configuration.IBMCompatibleSystem\" interface anywhere defined, right?",
