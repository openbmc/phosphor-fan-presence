# Example fan presence detection definitions

# List each fan within a system with the following parameters
# The 'Detection' value must have an associated fan presence detection app
# using the header file generated with its name(' ' replaced with '-')
#           "tach feedback" -> tach-feedback.hpp

#- Fan: [The given fan name within system inventory]
#  Detection: [A supported fan presence detection method]
#  Presence:
#        - Rotor: [The hwmon name for a detected fan rotor present]
#        - Rotor: [The hwmon name for a detected fan rotor present]
#  Inventory: [The system inventory location for the fan]
#  Description: [A meaningful description of fan, ie. location, type, etc...]
