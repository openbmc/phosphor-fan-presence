# Example fan presence detection definitions

# List each fan requiring presence detection and creation of an inventory object
# within a system with the following parameters. The 'Detection' method must
# have an associated fan presence detection application to properly handle
# detecting fans using that type.

#- [Detection method]:
#  - Fan: [A fan enclosure instance]
#    Sensors: [List of sensors associated with this fan enclosure]
#        - i.e) For tach feedback detection:
#                   The hwmon name for a detected fan rotor's tach feedback
#               For gpio detection:
#                   The hwmon pin name for the fan's presence line
#  Inventory: [The system inventory location for the fan]
#  Description: (Optional)
