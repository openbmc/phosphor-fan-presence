      "message": "Two comments here.  Both are just suggestions/things to think about vs. a bug.\n\nComment #1: You could use sdbusplus::bus::match::rules::interfacesAdded() and sdbusplus::bus::match::rules::argNpath() here instead of hardcoding the match properties.  Not a big deal, but might buy you a little abstraction in case the D-Bus match property names ever changed.\n\nComment #2: argNpath has kind of unexpected (to me) behavior.  From https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html\n\n\"... there is also a match when either the string given in the match rule or the appropriate message argument ends with \u0027/\u0027 and is a prefix of the other. An example argument path match is arg0path\u003d\u0027/aa/bb/\u0027. This would match messages with first arguments of \u0027/\u0027, \u0027/aa/\u0027, \u0027/aa/bb/\u0027, \u0027/aa/bb/cc/\u0027 and \u0027/aa/bb/cc\u0027.\"\n\nThat might be what you want, but I find it a little strange.  e.g. your rule would match if arg 0 is \u0027/\u0027.",

I think I\u0027ll use a separate commit to change that, and maybe not right now.\n\nFor the \u0027/\u0027 thing, looks like I wasn\u0027t even consistent with the existing matches for some reason.  I will remove the / on this one and the above one.",
