      "message": "I thought that the signal handler would already be called as part of the event loop since you created a sdeventplus::source::Signal and associated it with an sdeventplus::Event.  Is that not right?\n\nI\u0027m asking since I have similar code in the phosphor-regulators app.  I thought when I discussed this with Brad he said the sdeventplus code made the signal happen within the event loop vs. as a interrupt stack frame.  I may be misremembering though.",
