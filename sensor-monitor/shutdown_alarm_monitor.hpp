/**
 * @class ShutdownAlarmMonitor
 *
 * This class finds all instances of the D-Bus interfaces
 *   xyz.openbmc_project.Sensor.Threshold.SoftShutdown
 *   xyz.openbmc_project.Sensor.Threshold.HardShutdown
 *
 * and then watches the high and low alarm properties.  If they trip
 * the code will start a timer, at the end of which the system will
 * be shut down.  The timer values can be modified with configure.ac
 * options.  If the alarm is cleared before the timer expires, then
 * the timer is stopped.
 *
 * Event logs are also created when the alarms trip and clear.
 *
 * Note that the SoftShutdown alarm code actually implements a hard shutdown.
 * This is because in the system this is being written for, the host is
 * driving the shutdown process (i.e. doing a soft shutdown) based on an alert
 * it receives via another channel.  If the soft shutdown timer expires, it
 * means that the host didn't do a soft shutdown in the time allowed and
 * now a hard shutdown is required.  This behavior could be modified with
 * compile flags if anyone needs a different behavior in the future.
