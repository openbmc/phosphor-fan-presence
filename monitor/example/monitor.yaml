#Example fan monitor definitions for phosphor-fan-monitor

#List the fans that need to be monitored, along with some
#properties that define how much slack is allowed in the actual
#tach value as compared to the target tach value.

#- inventory:
#    [The system inventory location for the fan]
#  startup_allowed_out_of_range_time:
#    [Time (in secs) actual speed can be outside of deviation of
#     target speed on startup]
#  normal_allowed_out_of_range_time:
#    [Time (in secs) actual speed can be outside of deviation of
#     target speed after startup]
#  deviation:
#    [Percentage that actual speed must be within target speed]
#  num_sensors_nonfunc_for_fan_nonfunc:
#    [How many sensors on the fan must be faulted before fan
#     will be considered faulted]
#  sensors: [array of speed sensors for the fan]
#    - name [The name of the fan sensor]
#      has_target [true|false  If this sensor has a Target property for
#                  setting a fan speed (otherwise just for reads)]

#The code uses these parameters as follows:
#  After a speed reading of a sensor is outside of the allowed deviation of
#  the target speed for the allowed out of range time, if at least
#  num_sensors_nonfunc_for_fan_nonfunc sensors meet this condition,
#  the fan will be set to nonfunctional in the inventory.

#Example entries for 1 fan system:
#  - inventory: /system/chassis/motherboard/fan0
#    startup_allowed_out_of_range_time: 30
#    normal_allowed_out_of_range_time: 15
#    deviation: 15
#    num_sensors_nonfunc_for_fan_nonfunc: 1
#    sensors:
#      - name: fan0
#        has_target: true
