      "message": "Yes. The sensor doesn\u0027t have any one of the interfaces then this is failing.\n\nExample : If Hardshutdown High is configured for fansensor, then this will create only HardShutdownAlarmHigh property on D-Bus. The alarms map has both Alarm type as high and low. So, It is trying to get the both properties details. But only one property was generated on D-Bus. So, In this case, getting DbusMethodError and SdBusError.",
