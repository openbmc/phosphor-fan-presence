      "message": "Just out of curiosity, since this wraps the entire creation of the GPIO object with a try/catch would we be catching exceptions that we should instead crash from here or can this try/catch be moved into the GPIO object to isolate more on the evdev function that\u0027s throwing it?\n\nAlso, I dont see where it is defaulting this detection method to `not present` due to the exception?... Since we\u0027re catching this and staying up, we\u0027d want to log that unique event log and then set this GPIO detection method to `not present`.",
