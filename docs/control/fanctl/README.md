# Fan Control tool

A tool that enables a user to view the status of a system in regard to fan
control including the ability to manually set the fans to a desired RPM (or
PWM if supported by the system). This tool has been tested against systems
utilizing the phosphor-fan-presence repository set of fan applications (i.e.
romulus, witherspoon, etc...) and is not warranted to work on systems using
some other set of BMC fan applications.

## Intention

The intention of this tool is to temporarily stop the automatic fan control
algorithm and allow the user to manually set the fans within the system chassis
to a given target. Once a user no longer has a need to manually control the fans,
the resume operation re-enables and restarts the phosphor-fan-control service.
The status command provides a simple way to get the status of the fans along with
the the main system states and fan control systemd service, while the reload
command is available to commit JSON changes made to config files (YAML-based
configurations are not reloadable).

Note: In the case where a system does not have an active fan control algorithm
enabled yet, an intended safe fan target should be set prior to resuming.

## Usage

```
NAME
  fanctl - Manually control, get fan tachs, view status, reload config,
  and resume automatic control of all fans within a chassis.

SYNOPSIS
  fanctl [OPTION]

OPTIONS
set <TARGET> [TARGET SENSOR LIST]
    <TARGET>
        - RPM/PWM target to set the fans
    [TARGET SENSOR LIST]
        - space-delimited list of target sensors to set
get
    - Get the current fan target and feedback speeds for all rotors
status
    - Get the full system status in regard to fans
reload
    - Reload phosphor-fan configuration JSON files (YAML configuration not
      supported)
resume
    - Resume automatic fan control
    * Note: In the case where a system does not have an active fan control
      algorithm enabled yet, an intended safe fan target should be set
      prior to resuming
help
    - Display this help and exit
```

## Examples:

- Set all fans to a target value (The tool determines whether the machine is
    using RPM or PWM fan speeds, and sets them to the value provided):
    > fanctl set 10500

- Set only fan_0, fan1_0, fan2_0 to target 8500:
    > fanctl set 8500 fan0_0 fan1_0 fan2_0

- Resume automatic fan control:
    > fanctl resume

- Get the current fan target and feedback speeds for all rotors:
    > fanctl get

    ```
    > fanctl get

- Reload all json config files in the order each is found: override location,
    given `Compatible` interface location, default location.
