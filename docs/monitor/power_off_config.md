# power_off_config

## Description
A list of power off rules based on the monitoring state of the fans configured. These power off rules can perform different system power off types to protect a system that is not able to provide enough cooling due to a number of missing or nonfunctional fans.

## Attribute Value(s)
* `type` - ["hard", "soft", "epow"]
  * "hard" - Perform a hard shutdown that immediately powers off the system.
  * "soft" - Perform an orderly shutdown requesting that the host OS power off
  the system.
  * "epow" - Sets the thermal alert D-Bus property that a power off is imminent
  after a `service_mode_delay` amount of time passes.
* `cause` - ["missing_fan_frus", "nonfunc_fan_rotors"]
  * "missing_fan_frus" - Power off due to missing fan enclosures
  * "nonfunc_fan_rotors" - Power off due to nonfunctional fan
  rotors([`sensors`](sensors.md))
* `count` - integer
  * Number of the configured `cause` instances to begin the power off `type`

### "hard" & "soft" `type` power offs
* `delay` - integer
  * Time(in seconds) to delay performing the power off after `count` instances
  of the `cause` criteria is met.
* `state` - ["at_pgood", "runtime"] (Optional)
  * "at_pgood" - At system pgood, the power off rule becomes valid. A power off
  rule of *"at_pgood"* can halt a system power on if the conditions are met.
  * "runtime" - At system runtime, the power off rule becomes valid. A power
  off rule of *"runtime"* only goes into affect after the system reaches
  runtime. (Default)

### "epow" `type` power offs
* `service_mode_delay` - integer
  * Time(in seconds) given before the thermal alert D-Bus property is set to
  indicate that a power off is imminent if the `count` instances of the `cause`
  criteria still exists. This timer is canceled when the `count` instances of
  the `cause` is not longer met.
* `meltdown_delay` - integer
  * Time(in seconds) before a hard power off occurs after the
  `service_mode_delay` timer expires. This timer can not be canceled once
  started.
