At what point do we consider the config file that\u0027s optional is not actually there? We should discuss this as it\u0027ll become a possible problem once I complete fan control\u0027s conversion to JSON configs.",

A profile is not required if there\u0027s only one means of fan control, so that configuration file does not have to be given.
