#Example fan definitions for phosphor-fan-control

#List all fans that need to be known to phosphor-fan-control.
#For each fan, the inventory path, cooling zone, cooling zone
#profile, and sensor name(s).

#fans:
# - inventory: [The system inventory location for the fan]
#   cooling_zone: [The cooling zone number for the fan]
#   cooling_profile: [The cooling profile for the fan]
#   sensors: [The list of sensors for this fan]
#   target_interface: [The interface implemented by the fan target.
#                      Default is xyz.openbmc_project.Control.FanSpeed]
#   target_path: [The relative target path, which implements
#                 xyz.openbmc_project.Control.FanSpeed or
#                 xyz.openbmc_project.Control.FanPwm interface.
#                 Default is /xyz/openbmc_project/sensors/fan_tach/]

#The cooling zone, a number, and the cooling profile, a string,
#have to match the corresponding values in the fan zone yaml
#so the fans can be merged into the zone definition.

#Example entries for 2 fan system where fan0 uses default FanSpeed and
#fan1 uses FanPwm:
#fans:
#  - inventory: /system/chassis/motherboard/fan0
#    cooling_zone: 0
#    cooling_profile: all
#    sensors:
#     - fan0
#  - inventory: /system/chassis/motherboard/fan1
#    cooling_zone: 0
#    cooling_profile: air
#    sensors:
#     - fan1
#    target_interface: xyz.openbmc_project.Control.FanPwm
#    target_path: /xyz/openbmc_project/control/fanpwm/
