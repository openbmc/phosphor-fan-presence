#Example fan zone definitions for phosphor-fan-control

#List the properties of the fan zones that are possible in the system.
#The zones may be conditional based on certain conditions, such as
#different chassis types or water cooled models.  The fans themselves
#are not listed in this file.  They are in a separate YAML file so it
#can be machine generated (i.e. from the MRW) if desired.

#The general structure is a list of groups of zones, where a group
#contains both the zones and the conditions required for the zones
#to be valid

#The cooling_profile is used along with the zone number to know
#which fans in the fan yaml belong in this zone instance.  For
#example, a fan may only be in zone 0 if it's the air cooled version
#of the system, but not with the water cooled version.  In that
#case, the fan yaml would have a cooling_profile of 'air' to match
#the zone cooling profile.
