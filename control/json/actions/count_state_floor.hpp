 * @class CountStateFloor - Action to set a floor when members are at a state
 *
 * Sets the fans to a configured floor when a number of members within the
 * group are at a configured state. Once the number of members at the given
 * state falls below the configured count, the floor hold is released.
 *
 * Example JSON:
 *    {
 *      "name": "count_state_floor",
 *      "count": 1,
 *      "state": false,
 *      "floor": 5000
 *    }
 *
 * There is an optional 'delay' field that that prevents the floor from
 * being changed until the count has been met for that amount of time.
