      "message": "this is the host state not the host chassis state \n\n\npower should be fully applied, although the firmware and/or the os may not yet be available.\n\n\nlooking at the host state definition this was previously _not off_.  \nThe transition order (slipping ahead allowed) is\n\noff -\u003e [standby] -\u003e transition to running -\u003e running -\u003e quiesced -\u003e diagnostic mode \n\nremoving transition to running creates a hole between standby and running.\n\nIf you require host firmware or os to access the sensor or to log it ,(I didn\u0027t investigate where it\u0027s presently used), I suggest adding a host starting state to the enumeration.",

      "message": "It sounds like a flaw in the `phosphor-dbus-interfaces` spec. It talks about firmware, but what it means is `power`. As an example:\n\n*Host firmware should be off*, *Host firmware should be on* doesn\u0027t make much sense, but *Host power should be off*, *Host power should be on* sounds much better.\n            \nWhy is it even called `powerState` here when it\u0027s not about power, but about *firmware*?\n\nGiven that the terms `firmware` and `power` are kind of mixed here, one could think that `TransitioningToRunning` is about the power state. On the affected board it is about power, thus we need some thoughts how to fix it.",

      "message": "It depends on what you want your sensors depend on.  on our systems that don\u0027t use x86-power-control, we look at the  pgood property (The PGoodState class), but x86-power-control never ended up using that so someone added support to look at the Host state, which works for their sensors, and which I\u0027m fairly sure actual does reflect the power state, at least as far as On/Off goes.\n\nIf, for example, you\u0027d rather have it be based on the Chassis power state (though again I think that\u0027s the same as host state in x86-power-control), you can just derive a new class.",
