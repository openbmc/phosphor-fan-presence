      "message": "An example of using the service owned to drive this actions would be for running an action that sets fans to 100% pwm when a service providing a high priority sensor (i.e. ambient) is seen not running for X-number of seconds. (i.e. systemd restarts the ambient sensor service 3 times within Y-number of seconds, fans are set to 100% pwm after that service isnt on dbus for X seconds)\n\nAn example use case for using group values would be where a property is set on dbus, but additional time is needed before a fan control action should be performed. Such as when a device that contains a temp sensor is hot plugged, but that sensor does not become available for an action to use until after X-number of seconds.",
