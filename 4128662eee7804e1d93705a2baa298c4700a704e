      "message": "Thanks. As Inventory.Item interface needs to be added to EM configuration to provide for the generic interface case of this patch. I just pushed a patch in EM to add the interface to the global schema and add properties to its definition in openbmc-dbus schema: https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/entity-manager/+/66981. I suspect the legitimation of that patch because openbmc-dbus schema only defines more definitions down the tree under Inventory/Item such as Board, Chassis,... I don\u0027t know if I can make Inventory/Item as \"type\":\"object\" and add properties to it. Can you please help check a bit.",
